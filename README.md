# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with a keen interest in the front-end space. This includes design systems, Jamstack applications, and just generally trying to make great user experience across any product.

- ðŸ”­ I've been working on [KiwiSync](https://kiwisync.com/), a solution for connecting New Zealand-based bank accounts to YNAB. Unfortunately, this project is on hiatus due to prohibitive costs to get it all set up.
    - This may end up being open source soon!
- ðŸ’¬ Like all good developers, I've got some opinionated preferences on tooling and linting. Turns out anonymous functions shouldn't be used everywhere!
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently overhauling my personal site and taking the opportunity to try out some of the more hyped up frontend options at the moment. Neobrutalism design inbound!
